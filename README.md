# hello-world

Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape-shifting master of darkness, unleashed an UNSPEAKABLE EVIL.
But, a FOOLISH samurai warrior, WIELDING a magic sword, stepped forth to oppose me.
*WA-CHANG*
*WA-CHING*
*WA-CHENG*
Before the final blow was struck, I TORE open a portal in time and FLUNG him into the future, where my evil is LAW.
NOW the fool seeks to return to the past, and UNDO the future that is AKU.
